# Deployment Assistant Design Document

## 1. Introduction

**Project Goal:**  
Create a user-friendly, open-source deployment assistant that leverages AI to help users easily self-host applications from the [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) repository. The tool will guide users interactively through application selection and Docker container deployment, all while hiding complex technical details.

**Key Features:**
- **Interactive Conversational Interface:** Guides users step-by-step.
- **Automated Parsing:** Extracts application metadata from the awesome-selfhosted list.
- **Docker Configuration Generation:** Automatically creates `docker-compose` or Docker configuration files.
- **Deployment Orchestration:** Handles dependencies, networking, and persistent storage.
- **Security & Reliability:** Includes input validation, error handling, and logging.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

### Components

1. **Data Parser Module**  
    - **Purpose:** Fetch and parse the awesome-selfhosted repository to extract application details (name, description, dependencies, etc.).
    - **Outcome:** An internal catalog for quick lookup and selection.

2. **Conversational Interface**  
    - **Purpose:** Offer an interactive chat-based user interface (CLI or web-based) that leads the user through:
      - Selecting an application
      - Configuring deployment parameters (ports, volumes, environment variables)
      - Confirming deployment settings
    - **Outcome:** A dynamic, guided process that simplifies deployment steps.

3. **Docker Configuration Generator**  
    - **Purpose:** Using templating (e.g., via Jinja2), generate Docker configuration files based on user inputs.
    - **Outcome:** Tailored configuration files that map directly to the selected application's requirements.

4. **Deployment Orchestrator**  
    - **Purpose:** Automate the actual deployment by executing Docker (or docker-compose) commands.
    - **Outcome:** Verifies prerequisites, executes deployments, and provides rollback and troubleshooting support when needed.

5. **Security, Reliability, and Maintainability Layer**  
    - **Components:**
        - **Input Validation:** Checks for acceptable ports, file paths, and variable formats.
        - **Logging:** Records all deployment actions and errors.
        - **Modular Design:** Each component is designed for independent testing and future enhancement.
    - **Outcome:** A robust and secure deployment system that follows best practices.

## 3. Technology Stack Suggestions

- **Language:** Python (or another language that supports rapid prototyping and integration with Docker)
- **Web Framework / ChatBot Library:**  
  - Options: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for a web-based interface, or CLI libraries for a terminal-based approach
  - For the conversational interface, consider lightweight chatbot frameworks or NLP libraries.
- **Templating:** [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) for generating Docker configurations.
- **Docker Integration:**  
  - Use the [Docker SDK for Python](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to manage container operations.

## 4. Implementation Roadmap & Actionable Tasks

### Task 1: Build the Data Parser Module
- **Objective:** Automatically fetch and parse the awesome-selfhosted markdown or JSON data.
- **Action Steps:**
  1. **Fetch Source:** Utilize GitHub's API or direct file access to retrieve the repository list.
  2. **Parse Content:** Implement a parser (for Markdown or YAML) to extract key details (e.g., name, description, dependencies).
  3. **Catalog Creation:** Store the parsed data in a format suitable for quick lookups (JSON, SQLite, etc.).

> **Before:** Manual input or static listing of application details.  
> **After:** Dynamic, automated extraction that builds an up-to-date app catalog.

### Task 2: Develop the Conversational Interface
- **Objective:** Create an engaging and dynamic user interface that helps users select and configure their deployment.
- **Action Steps:**
  1. **Outline Conversation Flows:** Define the dialogue for choosing an application, inputting configuration parameters, and confirming the deployment.
  2. **Integrate AI/NLP (Optional):** Enhance conversation understanding using lightweight NLP models or predefined intents.
  3. **User Prompts:** Implement interactive prompts that gather necessary details such as ports, volumes, and environment variables.
  4. **Feedback Loop:** Allow users to review and modify their inputs before final processing.

> **Before:** Relying on static forms or documentation-based instructions.  
> **After:** A guided conversation that minimizes the risk of human error.

### Task 3: Create the Docker Configuration Generator
- **Objective:** Automatically generate Docker (or docker-compose) configuration files using user inputs.
- **Action Steps:**
  1. **Develop Base Templates:** Create baseline templates with placeholders for services, volumes, networks, and environment variables.
  2. **Dynamic Injection:** Write logic to fill these placeholders with user configurations.
  3. **Validation:** Ensure generated files are compliant with Docker Compose specifications using tools like `docker-compose config`.

> **Before:** Manual editing of Docker files.  
> **After:** Automated configuration file generation tailored to user selections.

---

### Task 4: Integrate the Deployment Orchestrator
- **Objective:** Automate the deployment process using Docker or Docker Compose commands.
- **Action Steps:**
  1. **Environment Checks:** Implement logic to verify Docker, docker-compose, and other dependencies are installed.
  2. **Execute Deployment:** Use Python's subprocess module or the Docker API to run the generated configurations.
  3. **Error Handling & Rollback:** Monitor for deployment errors, log issues, and provide rollback options if needed.
  4. **Real-time Feedback:** Stream logs and update users on deployment status through the conversational interface.

---

### Task 5: Ensure Security, Reliability, and Maintainability
- **Objective:** Build robust input validation and logging, and maintain a modular system design.
- **Action Steps:**
  1. **Input Sanitization:** Validate all user-provided inputs (ports, file paths, environment variables).
  2. **Logging & Error Reporting:** Develop a logging system to track actions and errors throughout the process.
  3. **Documentation:** Create both user and developer-facing documentation for usage and maintenance.
  4. **Modular Testing:** Make sure each module (parser, interface, configuration generator, orchestrator) is independently testable.

## 5. Testing & Verification Protocol

### Testing Components

1. **Parser Module Testing:**  
    - Test with expected GitHub formats.
    - Cover edge cases such as variations in repository file structure.

2. **Conversational Interface Testing:**  
    - Simulate complete conversation flows covering normal operation and error scenarios.
    - Validate the clarity and responsiveness of prompts.

3. **Docker Configuration Generation:**  
    - Validate generated configuration files by running `docker-compose config`.
    - Execute tests within containerized environments to mimic production.

4. **Deployment Orchestrator Validation:**  
    - Test full deployment workflows.
    - Simulate failures like port conflicts to ensure proper error handling and rollback procedures.

**Verification Steps for Each Test:**
1. Document the starting environment state.
2. Execute the specific command or walk through the conversation flow.
3. Record outputs and error messages.
4. Analyze and adjust based on feedback to refine the process.

## 6. Progressive Documentation & Next Steps

**Documentation Strategy:**  
- Maintain a living document (such as a GitHub Wiki) that updates design decisions, test results, and processing tweaks.
- Ensure all changes are logged to support future development and troubleshooting.

**Immediate Next Steps for the Coder:**
1. **Review and Validate:** Examine this document and identify any areas requiring deeper detail or assumptions that need clarification.
2. **Project Setup:** Establish the repository structure with placeholders for modules (data parser, conversational interface, configuration generator, orchestration engine).
3. **Initial Prototypes:** Create prototypes for the primary modules, starting with the data parser and conversation flow.
4. **Testing Environment:** Set up a testing environment to simulate deployments and validate generated Docker configurations.
5. **Feedback Integration:** After initial testing, iterate on the workflow and adjust the design as necessary.
